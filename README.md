# HumanitarianJobs-Extractor-Plus
HumanitarianJobs-Extractor-Plus is an advanced Python script tailored for job-seekers in the humanitarian sector. This project is the enhanced version of the earlier scraping tool, [UNJobs-Selective-Extractor](https://github.com/Op27/UNJobs-Selective-Extractor), and offers more refined capabilities for automated job scraping from international humanitarian job boards.

## Key Features
- **Automated Job Scraping**: Automatically extracts job listings from multiple humanitarian job boards using a dynamic URL parsing method based on selected countries.
- **Keyword Filtering**: Filters job listings by user-defined keywords to ensure the results are highly relevant to the searcherâ€™s interests.
- **Multi-Country Searches**: Supports scraping from multiple countries simultaneously, enhancing the script's utility for users looking for global opportunities.
- **Excel Output**: Organizes scraped data into an Excel spreadsheet with two sheets: one for all listings and another for listings that match priority keywords.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can easily add or remove keywords and countries through a simple graphical user interface, making the script flexible and user-friendly.

These features are designed to make the job search process more efficient and tailored, especially for professionals in the humanitarian sector.
